## Cost Optimization Tips

### Start Free
- $5 free credit on signup
- Plenty for initial testing
- ~1000-5000 web pages scraped

### Optimize Actor Usage
```
Expensive approach:
- Running actors continuously
- Not caching results
- Using premium proxies unnecessarily

Cost-effective approach:
- Schedule actors (daily, weekly)
- Cache and reuse data
- Use datacenter proxies when possible
- Set appropriate limits
```

### Proxy Strategy
```
Datacenter proxies: $0.80-1.50 per GB
- Use for: Most websites, non-blocking sites
- 10x cheaper than residential

Residential proxies: $8-15 per GB
- Use for: Difficult sites (LinkedIn, Instagram)
- Only when necessary
```

### Smart Scheduling
```
Instead of continuous monitoring:
- News scraping: Once daily (morning)
- Competitor prices: Weekly
- Lead generation: Batch weekly
- Social listening: Daily at off-peak

Reduces costs by 70-90%
```

## DIY vs. Pre-built Actors

### Use Pre-built Actors When:
- Standard use case (LinkedIn, Google Maps, etc.)
- Maintained and updated by Apify
- Already optimized for anti-blocking
- Quick to implement

**Cost: $0 (included in platform)**

### Build Custom Actors When:
- Specific to your business needs
- Scraping niche/proprietary sites
- Complex data processing logic
- Unique competitive advantage

**Cost: Development time (or hire developer for $500-2000 one-time)**

**ROI Calculation:**
```
Custom actor development: $1,500
Monthly value: $500 (vs. manual process)
Payback period: 3 months
3-year value: $18,000 - $1,500 = $16,500
```

## Building Your Own Actors

### When It Makes Sense

**Good candidates for custom actors:**
- Your competitors' websites (unique structure)
- Industry-specific directories
- Proprietary data sources
- Complex workflows combining multiple sources
- Internal tool automation

**Time to build:**
- Simple scraper: 2-4 hours
- Medium complexity: 1-2 days
- Complex workflow: 3-5 days

**Hiring a developer:**
- Upwork/Fiverr: $25-75/hour
- Apify experts: $50-150/hour
- Budget: $500-3000 for custom actor
