## Core Concepts

### Actors

Actors are serverless microapplications that perform specific tasks like scraping websites, processing data, or automating workflows. Think of them as containerized functions that:

- Run on Apify's cloud infrastructure
- Can be scheduled or triggered via API
- Accept inputs and produce structured outputs
- Can be chained together for complex workflows

### Datasets

Datasets are storage units for structured data extracted by actors. They provide:

- Automatic deduplication
- Multiple export formats (JSON, CSV, Excel, XML)
- API access to stored data
- Incremental data updates

### Proxies

Apify provides enterprise-grade proxy solutions:

- **Residential Proxies**: Real residential IPs from around the world
- **Datacenter Proxies**: Fast and cost-effective for most use cases
- **Smart Proxy**: Automatic rotation and session management

### Request Queues

Manage URLs to be processed by your actors:

- Automatic deduplication of URLs
- Persistent storage across runs
- Handles millions of URLs efficiently

## Common Use Cases

### Lead Generation & Enrichment
Scrape business directories, social media profiles, and company websites to build targeted lead lists with enriched contact information.

### Competitive Intelligence
Monitor competitor pricing, product catalogs, marketing strategies, and online presence across multiple channels.

### Market Research
Gather data from reviews, forums, social media, and news sites to understand market trends and consumer sentiment.

### Price Monitoring
