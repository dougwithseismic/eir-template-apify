# Apify Actor Template

This is a template for building Apify actors and making money on their marketplace. Instead of building a whole product, you just build a scraper and list it on Apify Store. They handle traffic, payments, all that.

## The Deal

Apify gets 50M visitors a month looking for scrapers. Build something useful, list it, collect revenue. Top actors pull $10K-50K/month. Even niche stuff does $500-3K.

With this template + Claude Code, you can build one in a week or two instead of grinding for a month.

## What's Here

**apps/actor** - Your scraper code (TypeScript + Playwright)
**apps/docs** - This docs site (for SEO, ranks for "[platform] scraper" searches)
**config/** - Site config
**packages/shared** - Reusable utilities

The docs site is important. Apify Store search is fine, but Google sends way more traffic if you rank for the right keywords.

## Guides

**[Entrepreneur Guide](/guides/apify-for-entrepreneurs)** - Making money with actors (pricing, marketing, scaling)
**[Creating Actors](/guides/creating-actors)** - Technical stuff
**[Deployment](/guides/deployment)** - How to deploy and price
**[Best Practices](/guides/best-practices)** - Code quality patterns

**[Apify for SDRs](/guides/apify-for-sdrs)** - Lead gen and prospecting
**[Apify for Founders](/guides/apify-for-founders)** - Market research

## Quick Start

Sign up: https://affiliate.apify.com/signup/32131

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run setup:apify  # Installs CLI and logs you in

cd apps/actor
# Edit src/main.ts - or ask Claude Code to write it
pnpm start:dev        # Test locally

# Deploy
pnpm run apify:push   # Pushes to Apify
# Then publish via console.apify.com

# Deploy docs (for SEO)
cd apps/docs
vercel
```

## Using Claude Code

This is the real time-saver. Instead of manually writing Playwright code for 2-4 hours:

1. Open `apps/actor/src/main.ts`
2. Ask Claude: "Help me scrape [data] from [URL]"
3. Claude writes it
4. Test with Playwright MCP
5. Done in 15-30 minutes

Genuinely 10x faster.

## Docs = SEO = Revenue

The docs site ranks you in Google for "[platform] scraper" searches. Way more traffic than just Apify Store search. Write a few guides about use cases and you'll start showing up.

Already configured with SEO stuff - metadata, sitemaps, etc.
